<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<p>Our objective is to help you achieve your project on time and within budget. On completion we want you to want us to carry out your next project. We always strive to add value to any scheme using our expertise to pro-actively advise on building concept, layout and materials etc. We always try to be fair and reasonable in all our dealings.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<p>Established in 1988 and operating from our base in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, our team has successfully completed a vast array of commercial, industrial, retail and domestic schemes, primarily in the private sector. We normally operate within a 50 mile radius of Harrogate but will travel further when specifically requested to by retained clients. The majority of our staff have been with us for many years and are respected for their skills and co-operative approach. We have undertaken new builds, major structural alterations and refurbishments in all sectors.</p>

<h2 id="proven">Proven</h2>

<p>A large proportion of our work is repeat business from satisfied customers and / or their professional advisers. Recommendation is by far the most important way that we get new contracts. Much of our work is secured on a negotiated or cost-plus basis. As with any other company we cannot get it 100% right 100% of the time, but where we do fall short of our normal standards we strive to put things right as quickly as possible and with the minimum of fuss.</p>

<p>Whilst we undertake both larger and smaller schemes, the majority of our contracts are in the £50,000 to £1,500,000 range.</p>
